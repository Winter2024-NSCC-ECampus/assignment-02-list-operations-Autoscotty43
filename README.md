# List Operations

A C++ program that performs various linked list operations, including sorting, merging, deleting nodes, and splitting lists.

## Features

- **Insertion & Sorting**: Adds elements to a linked list and sorts them in ascending order.
- **Node Deletion**: Removes the first node, last node, or a node at a specific index.
- **Front-Back Split**: Splits a linked list into two halves.
- **Sorting Multiple Lists**: Sorts two separate lists.
- **Merging Lists**: Merges two sorted lists into one sorted list.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Sorted List: 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 11 -> NULL
After deleting first node: 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 11 -> NULL
After deleting last node: 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
After deleting index 1: 3 -> 7 -> NULL
Front List: 3 -> NULL
Back List: 7 -> NULL
List A before sorting: 10 -> 5 -> 20 -> NULL
List B before sorting: 15 -> 3 -> 25 -> NULL
Sorted List A: 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> NULL
Sorted List B: 3 -> 15 -> 25 -> NULL
Merged Sorted List: 3 -> 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20 -> 25 -> NULL
